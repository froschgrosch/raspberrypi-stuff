# raspberrypistuff

A collection of raspberry pi stuff i wrote.

## Quake3

You will of course need the original game files (pak0.pk3 - pak8.pk3) for both of these.

### RPI-Quake3.sh

Compiles raspberrypi/quake3 (based on ioquake3) on the raspberry pi. Runs decently on a Pi 2.

### compile_q3e.sh

Compiles ec-/quake3e. Only tested on a pi2, performance is worse on the Broadcom videocore IV compared to ioq3. Might run better on a pi 4. Recommended for dedicated server usage.
